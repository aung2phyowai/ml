# Principal component analysis

From Bishop (2006), p. 561:

> There are two commonly used definitions of PCA that give rise to the same algorithm. PCA can be defined as the orthogonal projection of the data onto a lower dimensional linear space, known as the principal subspace, such that the variance of the projected data is maximized (Hotelling, 1933). Equivalently, it can be defined as the linear projection that minimizes the average projection cost, defined as the mean squared distance between the data points and their projections (Pearson, 1901).
